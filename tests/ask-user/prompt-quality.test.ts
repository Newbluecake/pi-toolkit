const EXPECTED_DESCRIPTION = `Ask the user to resolve ambiguity you cannot resolve yourself. Use ONLY when ALL hold: (1) the request has ≥2 reasonable approaches, (2) you have already gathered context (read/grep) and the answer is still genuinely ambiguous, and (3) picking wrong means redoing real work. One question = one decision with mutually exclusive options.

Do NOT use this tool to outsource judgment you should make — if you can form a defensible recommendation from the codebase, proceed and state your choice. Do NOT use for trivia answerable by reading code/docs, or for simple confirmations ("I'll delete X") where plain text suffices. You cannot use this tool to collect free-form requirements, long-form feedback, or multi-paragraph input — it returns short selections only.

If you recommend an option, prefix its label with "(Recommended)" and list it first. For structured multi-option decisions, prefer this tool over plain-text questions; for everything else, reply in plain text. In multi-question mode give each question a short header (<=12 chars) for the tab bar; if you omit it, one is derived from the question text.

Examples:
{"questions":[{"question":"Which DB?","context":"Need ACID + JSON columns.","options":[{"label":"(Recommended) Postgres","description":"Mature, strong consistency."},{"label":"SQLite","description":"Zero-ops, embedded."}]}]}

{"questions":[{"header":"DB","question":"Which database?","options":[{"label":"Postgres","description":"..."},{"label":"SQLite","description":"..."}]},{"header":"Region","question":"Which region?","options":[{"label":"us-east-1","description":"..."},{"label":"eu-west-1","description":"..."}]}]}

Don't:
- Passing options as a string array ("options":["A","B"]) — each option must be {"label","description"}.
- Flattening question/header/options to the top level — wrap them in questions:[...].
- Including an "Other" option — it is added automatically.`;
const EXPECTED_GUIDELINES = [
  "Use ask_user only when the request has ≥2 reasonable approaches you cannot resolve from context. Models over-ask because asking feels safer than deciding — resist this: if context makes the answer clear, proceed without asking.",
  "Gather context first (read/grep) and pass a short summary via the context field — don't ask blind. If the answer becomes clear after gathering context, proceed and state your choice.",
  "Ask focused questions; each question = one decision with mutually exclusive options. Batch related decisions into one call (1-4 questions).",
  "In multi-question mode (2-4 questions) give each question a short header (<=12 chars) — it labels the tab; an omitted header is auto-derived from the question text.",
  "Do NOT use ask_user for trivia answerable by reading code/docs, or to confirm simple actions ('I'll delete X') — plain text suffices there.",
  "Do NOT outsource judgment you can make yourself: if you can form a defensible recommendation from the codebase, proceed and state it instead of asking.",
