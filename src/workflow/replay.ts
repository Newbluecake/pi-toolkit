/**
 * M3.5 (workflow design §6.2/§6.3/§6.4): the replay *decision* layer —
 * builds an in-memory lookup index from a `JournalStore.load()` result and
 * decides, per `agent()` submission, whether an entry may be reused
 * (§6.4 RP1–RP9, narrowed to the RPs this milestone's `agent()` surface can
 * actually violate — see the module doc below for which are structurally
 * always-true here and why).
 *
 * RP scope note: RP2 (no `resume`) and RP5 (schema re-validation) are
 * vacuously satisfied — the current `agent()` host-call surface
 * (host.ts's `handleAgent`) has no `resume`/`schema` option at all, so no
 * journaled entry could ever have come from one. RP8 (`v` supported) is
 * enforced by `journal.ts#parseEntry` itself (an unsupported `v` fails the
 * shape guard and is counted as a corrupt line, never reaches the index).
 * RP10/RP11 (MCP tool-set hashing / content-scope warning banner) are
 * genuine gaps — this milestone's `agent()` surface has no MCP-awareness to
 * hash, and the content-scope risk banner is a UI/tool-layer concern above
 * `src/workflow/**`.
