/**
 * M3.2 (workflow design §4.4.3 `BudgetTree`, §4.4 CC4/BW1-BW10): derives one
 * `agent()` call's absolute `deadlineAt` from the workflow's own remaining
 * budget. This is the *only* place in the workflow module that computes a
 * child's deadline — `host.ts` calls it once per `agent()` admission and
 * threads the result straight into `SpawnRequest.deadlineAt` (CC4, already
 * landed core-side in M3.0 — see `src/core/state-machine.ts`'s `enqueued`
 * branch and `src/service/spawn-service.ts`'s `spawn()` CP1 check).
 *
 * §4.4.3 also has a `phaseDeadlineAt` input (phases are a per-`phase()`
 * concept). M3.2 has no phase-tracking state machine yet (that lands with
 * the full reduce/effect pipeline in M3.3/M3.4) — `WorkflowBudgetView` still
 * carries the field so the shape matches the design and so a future
 * milestone can wire it without changing this function's contract, but for
 * now every caller passes `phaseDeadlineAt: undefined`, which is exactly
 * BW10's `phaseTotalMs=0 ⇒ phaseRemaining=+∞` case.
 *
 * BW10's *workflow* half (`workflowTotalMs=0 ⇒ workflowDeadlineAt` absent) is
 * forbidden at the configuration layer (workflow-agent-queue plan §0 Major-2):
 * `workflow.budget.workflowTotalS` must be > 0. The `undefined` handling below
 * survives only as a defensive branch.
