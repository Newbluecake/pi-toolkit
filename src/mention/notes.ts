/**
 * X6b: latest raw user @ message per run, surfaced by the fleet widget one line
 * below the run's tool trail (and as the ONLY awaiting-entry preview).
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 * - steer path (@ running run): the note is "pending" with a baseline timestamp
 *   captured when the steer landed. Once the target run starts a NEW model turn
 *   after that baseline (turn_start = the steered message entered the model's
 *   context), the note has served its purpose and self-clears on the next read.
 *   The check keys off diag.lastTurnStartAt — a sticky stamp written only by
 *   turn_start — because pi emits message_end for the steered user message
 *   microseconds after turn_start (agent-loop.js: turn_start → message_start /
 *   message_end → stream), so lastEventType === "turn_start" is never observable
 *   by the widget's 1Hz poll.
 * - resume path (@ terminal run → new run): the note IS the new run's task
 *   description, so it is pinned — it persists for the run's whole lifetime and
 *   doubles as the awaiting-pickup preview after the run settles (terminal runs
 *   emit no further events, so a pending note would never clear anyway; pinning
 *   is explicit about it).
 *
 * Session-scoped, capped FIFO; notes are one-line previews, never read back
 * into context.
