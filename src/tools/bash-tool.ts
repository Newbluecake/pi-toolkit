/**
 * bash auto-background §2 — the same-name override of pi's built-in `bash`
 * tool: a foreground call that outlives the configured threshold returns early
 * with a `job_id` while **the process keeps running** (§1 Z1/Z2).
 *
 * Compatibility doctrine (§2.1/§2.3): the short-command path is not an
 * imitation of the built-in tool, it *is* the built-in tool. Every call builds
 * a real `createBashToolDefinition(ctx.cwd, { operations })` and delegates to
 * its `execute`; output accumulation, truncation, the temp-file footer,
 * `(no output)`, `Command exited with code N`, `Command aborted`,
 * `Command timed out after Ns` and the 100 ms-throttled `onUpdate` stream are
 * all produced by pi's own code, and the resolve/reject is passed through
 * verbatim. The only thing this file owns is:
 *
 *  - `BashOperations.exec` — routed through `BashJobManager` so the process is
 *    a detached group leader with its output tee'd to a job log (the built-in
 *    accumulator still gets every byte, so the foreground result is unchanged);
 *  - `race(inner, threshold)` plus the relay/abort state gate copied from
 *    `agent-tool.ts:318-334`: after backgrounding, a caller abort must **not**
 *    reach the process (§2.4), and the inner promise is handed to the manager
 *    so its eventual settlement lands in `finalText` instead of becoming an
 *    unhandled rejection (§2.3).
 *
 * Layering: no session/stack state is captured — the manager and the threshold
 * arrive as getters so `src/index.ts` can forward the current stack's instance
 * (the extension re-activates in-process on `/reload`).
 */
