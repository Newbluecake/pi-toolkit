/**
 * CC4/FF4 (workflow design §4.4.1.1): explicit classification of every
 * `SpawnRequest` field into "must be threaded through to `ResolvedSpawnRequest`
 * as-is" vs "consumed/transformed elsewhere, never threaded verbatim".
 *
 * This is the fix for a real, previously-committed failure mode in this repo:
 * `runtime/runner.ts`'s `ResolvedSpawnRequest.parentRunId` doc comment records
 * that `parentRunId` used to be silently dropped because nothing threaded it
 * past `RunnerSpec.request` into the object literal `runtime-adapter.ts` built
 * for the runner. Hand-written `...(x === undefined ? {} : { x })` spreads at
 * the call site have no compile-time signal when a *new* `SpawnRequest` field
 * is added and nobody remembers to add a matching spread line — the field is
 * just silently absent from `ResolvedSpawnRequest` forever.
 *
 * The two `never`-exhaustiveness assertions below turn that into a compile
 * error instead: every key of `SpawnRequest` MUST appear in exactly one of
 * `THREADED` / `NOT_THREADED`, or `tsc --noEmit` fails pointing at the
 * assertion. See `tests/fixtures/ff4-*` for the negative fixtures that prove
 * the gate actually fires (WC13).
