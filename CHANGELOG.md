## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`switch_context` tool（上下文切换）** — 模型把「要带到下一段上下文的状态」直接写进工具参数（`goal` / `progress` / `next_steps` / `decisions` / `key_files` / `pitfalls` / `open_questions`），这段文本经 `session_before_compact` 直接成为 pi 压缩条目的 summary：**不再跑第二次摘要 LLM**，保留什么完全由模型决定。`keep_recent:false` 时压缩点之前的消息全部丢弃（真正的「换到下一个会话」语义），但会话文件、在跑的 subagent、后台 bash 任务、todo 与成本统计都不受影响。扩展还会自动补一段机械附录：本段读/改过的文件、仍在跑的 subagent 与 bash 任务、未完成的 todo、上一段会话文件路径。交接内容过短或缺必填字段会被工具当场打回，不触发压缩。

- **Merged `ask_user` and Feishu notifications** — the package now exposes the interactive clarification tool and Feishu notification extension through three pi entries. Completion, subagent-summary, and idle cards wait for a background-idle session; heartbeat, waiting-input, and explicit notifications remain immediate.
- **Background status provider** — the host publishes live subagent and background-bash counts through a reload-safe global provider.

- **Background status provider** — the host publishes live subagent and background-bash counts through a reload-safe global provider.

- **`compact_context` tool** — the model can proactively trigger context compaction (equivalent to `/compact`) instead of waiting for the automatic threshold. Registered only in the host session; an in-flight guard plus cooldown refuses back-to-back triggers, and an optional follow-up message resumes the task on the summarized context. Configured via `compact.enabled` (default on).

- **message fabric** — an opt-in, fire-and-forget message protocol for subagent runs. The `message_agent` tool sends `progress`, `finding`, or `directive` messages through tree-edge routing with `canMessage` relationship gating; delivery is bounded by per-link quotas and throttling, with dead-letter handling for failed actionable messages and a root ingress gate for context traffic. Agent-type frontmatter can declare allowed relationships, and the 11-key `fabric.*` configuration surface is disabled by default for gradual rollout.

### Breaking / Migration

- **`compact_context` 默认不再注册**：`compact.switchTool`（默认 `true`）开启后，模型面只暴露 `switch_context`。需要旧工具并存时设 `compact.keepCompactTool: true`；要完全回到旧行为设 `compact.switchTool: false`。强制压缩安全网不受影响——它在扩展内部直接调用 pi 的压缩，不依赖工具是否注册。

- Remove the standalone `@bluecake/pi-ask-user` package before enabling the merged entries. Existing Feishu configuration is reused; a startup conflict warning indicates the old package is still loaded.

### Changed

- **compact-hint 三层改为催「自写交接」** — usage tick 与 L1 提示改为推荐 `switch_context`；L2 强制层改为先礼后兵：越过强制线时先硬性要求模型在本回合调用 `switch_context`（次数由 `compact.forceDemandTurns` 控制，默认 1），只有它不照办才回落到原来的通用强制压缩。交接文本已暂存、压缩尚未完成时，既不再催也不会抢先强制压缩。

- **`get_subagent_result` description** — now states the poll-guard contract explicitly (reads never consume the run; rapid repeated polling of the same run returns a warning — await the completion notification), matching the wording `bash_job` has carried since the guard landed.

- **poll guard retuned to real loop shapes** — the frequency window for non-blocking reads (`get_subagent_result` without wait, `bash_job` status) is now 120s/3 calls per key, up from 10s: each poll costs a full model turn (seconds to tens of seconds), so a 10s window only ever caught same-message bursts and never a real cross-turn polling loop. Blocking waits are no longer frequency-counted at all; instead a consecutive-timeout streak guards them — a wait blocks up to its budget by design, so the loop signal is the same run/job timing out again and again. The first timeout already states the two ways out (raise `wait_ms`, or end the turn and await the completion notification); from the 2nd consecutive timeout the message escalates with the streak count and cumulative time spent blocked, and any terminal outcome resets the streak.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- **subagent result text** — completed runs now use the final assistant message as their outcome text, including the value returned to workflow `agent()` calls, instead of concatenating all streamed narrative deltas.

- **fleet widget** — the agent tree no longer blinks off/on after `/reload`. pi's reload re-imports the extension as a fresh module (jiti `moduleCache:false`), so the module-level `previousFleetWidget` handoff never saw the pre-reload controller; and since the stale `ctx.ui` closures keep working (`setWidget` has no `assertActive`), the old controller's self-rescheduling 1Hz tick outlived its session forever, pushing `setWidget(undefined)` over the new session's frames — one extra blink per reload. `Stack` now exposes `fleetWidget` and `session_shutdown` disposes it.

### Changed

- **subagent result tools** — completed text returned by `Agent`, `get_subagent_result`, and nested `Agent` calls is capped by the live `resultMaxChars` setting (default 8000, 0 for unlimited), with a session transcript path for full output.

- **fleet widget / tool card** — the thinking phase label is now animated: the icon cycles through four emoji frames (`🧠思考 → 💭思考 → 🤔思考 → 💡思考`) derived from wall time (1s quantum), so the 1Hz widget/panel tick advances it by exactly one frame with no render-side animation state. Frames are deliberately unambiguous-width emoji — an earlier braille-spinner version wrap-flickered CJK terminals (braille is East Asian Ambiguous: terminals render it 2 columns, string-width measures 1). `phaseLabel(phase, diag)` without a `now` keeps the static `🧠思考` form.

- **bash jobs** — `bashJobs.dir` is now a root containing one sanitized `<sessionId>/` directory per pi session; flat records are migrated when their owner is dead, list/status visibility is session-scoped, and in-process reload/new/fork transfers live jobs. Cold starts adopt owner-dead orphan jobs. Session directories are garbage-collected with the same `.json`/`.log`/`.tmp` safety rules as the job store; this is visibility isolation, not an OS security boundary.

### Added

- **bash auto-backgrounding** — the built-in `bash` tool is overridden by name (POSIX only) so a
  foreground command that outlives `bashJobs.autoBackgroundS` (default 120s) no longer blocks the
  turn: the call returns a `job_id`, **the process is not killed**, its merged stdout/stderr keeps
  streaming into `~/.pi/agent/bash-jobs/<job>.log`, and a `bash-job:notification` message (with the
  output tail, `triggerTurn`) is injected exactly once when it exits — including after a `/reload` or
  a pi restart, where still-running jobs are re-adopted from disk and a job whose pid ownership
  cannot be verified is marked, never killed. Short commands are byte-for-byte the built-in tool's
  own result (the foreground path delegates to pi's bash implementation, including its `timeout`,
  abort and truncation semantics), so the only intentional behaviour change is that a command past
  the threshold returns a `job_id` instead of blocking indefinitely. New `bash` parameter
  `run_in_background: true` backgrounds immediately; the new `bash_job` tool inspects and stops jobs with four
  actions (`status` / `wait` / `kill` / `list`): `status` returns a state summary **plus the tail of the log**
  (last 20 lines / 2KB, context-guarded), `wait` is bounded, `kill` is idempotent and pid-reuse guarded, `list`
  enumerates known jobs. There is deliberately no `output` action — the log is a plain file
  (`~/.pi/agent/bash-jobs/<job>.log`) and every model-facing string (tool descriptions, the backgrounding replies,
  the completion notice, `/agent status`) says so, so the model reads it with the `read` tool or with
  `tail`/`grep`/`awk` instead of being confined to a tool's parameters. The log is also self-contained: a single
  footer line — `[pi-subagent] job b_XXXXXXXX completed (exit 0) after 2m30s`, with no exit code invented for
  killed / timed-out / exit-code-lost jobs — is appended once when the process settles, counted in the log's byte
  total, and written even past `maxLogBytes` so a `tail -3` always reveals the outcome. Configured under `bashJobs.*` (`autoBackgroundS` — `0` disables the whole
  feature and registers no override, `maxLogBytes`, `maxBackgroundJobs`, `retentionS`,
  `shutdownPolicy`, plus JSON-only `dir` / `shellPath`) and surfaced in `/agent status`. Only jobs
  that actually reached the model as a `job_id` are retained: a command that finished in the
  foreground already returned its full result through the tool call, so its record and log are
  dropped shortly after it settles instead of lingering for `retentionS` and burying `bash_job
list` under every `echo`. Retention itself is a whole-directory sweep: besides expired terminal
  records it also reaps the litter that never becomes a record — unreadable/badly named `.json`
  files, orphan `.log` files with no record beside them (aged by file mtime, and never while the
  job is still tracked in memory) and `.tmp` debris from an interrupted atomic write (fixed 1h
  TTL) — each such deletion is WARNed. Only `.json` / `.log` / `.tmp` names are ever touched, a
  file whose mtime cannot be compared to the clock is always kept, and a non-terminal record is
  never pruned. The sweep runs on session start **and**, throttled to once per 10 minutes, when a
  new bash job is created, so a session that stays open for days still cleans up — without adding
  a single timer.
- **Zero-build git installs** — the `pi.extensions` manifest now points at a source-form
  root entry (`./index.ts` → `./src/index.js`), which pi loads through its bundled jiti
  TypeScript runtime. `pi install git:github.com/Newbluecake/pi-subagent` and
  `pi update --extension ...` now work end to end despite `dist/` staying gitignored (pi's
  git install runs no build). The `@earendil-works/pi-*` peers are marked
  `peerDependenciesMeta.optional` (pi aliases them to its own bundled modules) and duplicated
  in `devDependencies`, so pi's `npm install --omit=dev` in the clone no longer pulls a
  second copy of pi. The compiled `index.js`/`dist` entries remain for npm/Node consumers.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- **Caller-ack notification suppression (delivery v2 P3)** — foreground callers can acknowledge completed outcomes to suppress undelivered notifications; the `ackWindowMs` hold window is disabled by default and fails open on persistence or cancellation errors.
- **`abort_subagent` tool** — stop a running subagent by run id, unique prefix, or Agent label; terminal runs return an idempotent already-finished result.
- **Foreground auto-backgrounding** — foreground Agent calls now return after 10 minutes by default when the run is still active; the run is not stopped and can be collected with `get_subagent_result`.
- **Fuzzy model hints** (parity with upstream @tintinweb/pi-subagents) — agent
  frontmatter `model:` and the Agent tool's `model` param now accept a bare model
  id (`kimi-k3`) or a case-insensitive substring alias (`sonnet`, `haiku`) in
  addition to a strict `provider/id`, resolved against pi's available models at
  spawn admission (`src/config/model-hint.ts`; matching tiers: strict pair →
  exact id → id prefix → id substring → display-name substring, candidate order
  breaks ties). Unresolvable hints are rejected with a self-correcting config
  error before any state write — never silently downgraded to the parent/default
  model. Pinned models are shown in the injected "Available subagent types"
  prompt section, and `modelHint` participates in the agent-type config hash so
  editing a hint correctly misses workflow journal replays.

### Fixed

- **Extension shows as "pi-subagent/index.js" in pi's resource list** — pi names
  package extension items after the entry file's location
  (`<parentDir>/<fileName>`), so the old `./dist/index.js` entry displayed as
  "dist/index.js". The `pi.extensions` entry now points at a thin package-root
  `index.js` re-export; the compiled implementation still lives in `dist/`.

- **Sub-phase deadline enforcement is real now** — the `EventWatchdog` was constructed with
  `getState`/`dispatch` no-op stubs ("M1 documented limitation"), so `idleMs`, `firstEventMs`,
  `toolMs`, etc. were computed and armed but never fired; only the runner's total-budget
  `setTimeout` race actually terminated a wedged run. A slow-but-trickling provider stream
  therefore hung the run until `totalMs`. The watchdog is now late-bound to the live runner
  (`getRunState` + new `fireDeadline`, which folds `deadline_fired` into the state machine
  and cancels the run's CancelHandle so the prompt guard unblocks immediately).
- **`retry_backoff` blind spot** — `dueAtFor` had no branch for it and `deadline_fired` was
  explicitly ignored there, so a wedged pi auto-retry could keep a run alive forever.
  Now backed by `idleDueAt` (covers the current backoff delay + slack).
- **`model_turn` idle semantics** — the old `phaseEnteredAt + idleMs` rule would have
  false-killed legitimately long thinking turns once enforcement was on. Now the idle
  deadline is silence-based (`lastEventAt + idleMs`), plus a new per-turn hard cap
  `modelTurnMs` (default 15 min) so a trickling turn still dies bounded.
- **Timeout outcomes no longer misreported as `aborted`** — cancelling the prompt guard
  after a watchdog deadline now yields `timed_out` with the original `timeoutReason`
  (e.g. `idle`), not `aborted`/`"total"`.
- **`prompt_dispatch` phase actually entered** — the runner never dispatched it, so a hung
  `prompt()` sat in `extension_bind` and would have reported a misleading bind timeout.
- New budget field: `modelTurnMs` (default `900_000`, `0` disables).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-01

First public release: anti-hang subagent extension for pi — drop-in replacement for
`@tintinweb/pi-subagents` core (`Agent` / `get_subagent_result` / `steer_subagent`).

### Features

- **Core**: pure run state machine with per-phase deadline budget (`d295ade`)
- **Runtime/service**: slot pool, session driver, runner, watchdog, escalating reaper, spawn/query services, notifier outbox (`6421dbd`)
- **Tools**: `Agent`, `get_subagent_result`, `steer_subagent` + `/agent status` command (`049e7a0`)
- **Presentation**: live execution visibility — model/label/tool-trail in diagnostics, streaming foreground tool card, agent-tree widget above the editor, completion notifications (`d713afb`)
- **Agent tree**: workflow group headers, theme colors, human-friendly phase labels, live activity line (thinking stream + tool trail with args preview on its own row) (`e287942`, `2d25b32`, `46c9cf7`, `d51f07a`)
- **Tools**: subagent spend flows into pi's session cost totals; real-time 1Hz usage broadcast (`a477efe`, `0450568`)
- **Delivery**: human-first notification head — `Subagent "label" (#shortId) status` (`65f2dab`)
- **Index**: inject registered agent types into the system prompt via `before_agent_start` (`735143b`)
- **Tools**: `renderCall` for the Agent tool card — task label, type, background/resume/isolation markers (`9c5f830`)
- **Workflow**: sandboxed `SubagentWorkflow` engine — worker + VM isolation, two-phase host-call protocol, script API (`agent`/`parallel`/`pipeline`/`phase`), abort propagation, journal & replay (`edbdd91`…`745e831`)
- **M2**: worktree isolation, resume, nested delegation (X3), structured output (X10), dynamic tool scope (X11), usage accumulation (`0c04d6b`, `6afc6de`, `5ba2a41`)
- **M3**: scheduler (X5), `@mention` steering (X6), RPC wiring (X8) (`b8baa40`)
- **Config**: built-in `general-purpose` and `Plan` agent types; user settings from `~/.pi/agent/pi-subagent.json` (`91deff8`, `6bc4cef`)

### Bug Fixes

- **state-machine**: keep `tool_exec` until the LAST parallel tool settles — the tree's tool-vs-model distinction was wrong mid-parallel-calls (`535e717`)
- **presentation**: model always shown as `provider/id` — the bare id is ambiguous across providers (`f2cfd9c`)
- **index**: release the globalThis host claim on `session_shutdown` so pi `/reload` re-activation works; child sessions stay inert (`04ac9b5`, `d4ff8b6`, `a82b5f1`)
- **runtime**: map pi `Usage.cost.total` to `costUsd` — raw pass-through NaN-poisoned the accumulator (`0ccbb37`)
- **query/delivery**: in-flight runs visible in registry; no duplicate notifications on restart (`e6ca57b`)
- **driver**: resolve model overrides via ModelRegistry + surface turn errors (`7df9307`)
- **resume**: release both resume lock keys — P1 lock leak (`4b2189a`)
